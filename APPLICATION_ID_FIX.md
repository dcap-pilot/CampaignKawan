# 🔧 Application ID Mismatch Fix

## ❌ Problem Identified

Your form is showing **different Application IDs**:

- **Success Page**: `APP-1759916474755-NMU62O` (Frontend generated)
- **Google Sheet**: `APP-1759916466341-6MN34A` (Backend generated)
- **Google Drive Folder**: `APP-1759916466341-6MN34A` (Backend generated)

## 🔍 Root Cause

The issue occurs because:

1. **GET request fails** with 400 Bad Request (URL too long with file data)
2. **Fallback POST with no-cors** runs successfully but can't read the response
3. **Frontend generates its own Application ID** since it can't get the backend response
4. **Backend generates a different Application ID** and saves it to Google Sheet/Drive

## ✅ Solution Applied

I've updated the code to:

1. **Try POST first** (instead of GET) to handle large data
2. **Better fallback handling** that tries to retrieve the correct Application ID
3. **Lookup function** in Google Apps Script to find Application ID by NRIC
4. **Improved error handling** and logging

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Update Google Apps Script

1. **Go to**: https://script.google.com/
2. **Open** your project: `Campaign Kawan - Form Handler`
3. **Delete ALL code** and paste the updated `google-apps-script.js`
4. **Save** (Ctrl+S)
5. **Redeploy**: 
   - Click "Deploy" > "Manage deployments"
   - Click ✏️ edit icon
   - Change "Version" to "New version"
   - Make sure "Who has access" = **"Anyone"**
   - Click "Deploy"

### Step 2: Update Your Website

1. **Open** `script.js`
2. **Save** the file (the updated code is already there)
3. **Test** the form submission

### Step 3: Test the Fix

1. **Fill out** the form with test data
2. **Submit** the form
3. **Check browser console** - should see:
   ```
   === SUBMITTING TO GOOGLE SHEETS ===
   Attempting POST request...
   Response status: 200
   ✓ Successfully submitted to Google Sheets!
   Application ID: APP-1234567890-ABCDEF
   ```
4. **Verify** the Application ID matches on:
   - Success page
   - Google Sheet
   - Google Drive folder

## 🔍 What Changed

### Frontend (`script.js`)
- ✅ **POST request first** instead of GET (handles large data better)
- ✅ **Better fallback handling** that tries to retrieve the correct Application ID
- ✅ **Improved error messages** and logging

### Backend (`google-apps-script.js`)
- ✅ **Lookup function** to find Application ID by NRIC
- ✅ **Enhanced GET handler** to support lookup requests
- ✅ **Better logging** for debugging

## 🎯 Expected Results

After the fix:

✅ **POST request succeeds** (no more 400 errors)  
✅ **Same Application ID** on success page, Google Sheet, and Drive folder  
✅ **No more CORS issues**  
✅ **Proper error handling** if something goes wrong

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Before Testing:
- [ ] Google Apps Script updated and redeployed
- [ ] `script.js` updated
- [ ] Browser cache cleared (Ctrl+F5)

### During Testing:
- [ ] Fill form with test data
- [ ] Submit form
- [ ] Check browser console for success messages
- [ ] Verify Application ID on success page
- [ ] Check Google Sheet for matching Application ID
- [ ] Check Google Drive for matching folder name

### Expected Console Output:
```
=== SUBMITTING TO GOOGLE SHEETS ===
Attempting POST request...
Response status: 200
Response ok: true
✓ Successfully submitted to Google Sheets!
Application ID: APP-1759916466341-6MN34A
```

### Expected Google Apps Script Logs:
```
=== POST REQUEST RECEIVED ===
Parsed data successfully
=== PROCESSING FORM DATA ===
Generated Application ID: APP-1759916466341-6MN34A
✓ Successfully saved to sheets
✓ File upload completed
=== FORM PROCESSING COMPLETED ===
```

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

### Check These:

1. **Google Apps Script Deployment**
   - Go to https://script.google.com/
   - Click "Deploy" > "Manage deployments"
   - Verify "Who has access" is **"Anyone"**
   - If not, edit and redeploy

2. **Browser Console**
   - Press F12
   - Look for any red errors
   - Should see "Attempting POST request..." message

3. **Google Apps Script Logs**
   - Go to https://script.google.com/
   - Click "Executions" in left sidebar
   - Look for recent executions
   - Click on them to see detailed logs

4. **File Size**
   - If files are very large (>5MB), they might cause issues
   - Try with smaller test files first

## 📊 Why This Fixes the Issue

**Before:**
1. GET request fails (URL too long)
2. Fallback POST with no-cors runs
3. Frontend can't read response, generates local ID
4. Backend generates different ID
5. **Result: Different IDs everywhere**

**After:**
1. POST request succeeds (handles large data)
2. Frontend gets proper response with backend ID
3. Same ID used everywhere
4. **Result: Consistent Application ID**

---

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

✅ **No CORS errors** in browser console  
✅ **POST request returns 200 status**  
✅ **Same Application ID** on success page and in Google Sheet/Drive  
✅ **Files upload successfully** to Google Drive  
✅ **Data appears correctly** in Google Sheet

## 🔄 Alternative Solution (If Still Issues)

If the POST request still fails, I can implement a **chunked upload system** that:

1. Splits large data into smaller chunks
2. Uploads chunks separately
3. Reassembles them on the backend
4. Ensures consistent Application ID

But the current fix should resolve the issue for most cases.
